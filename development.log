* Product 2: variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Taken Wine Co., price: 40.0, description: This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture., title: Taken Wine Co. 2014 Taken Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 88, province: California

It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington
* Product 5: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost.

* Product 2: variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon
* Product 3: variety: Grenache, winery: Donkey & Goat, price: 28.0, description: This medium-bodied wine walks its own path, smelling like flowers, honey and ripe peaches. It tastes fresh, nicely tart, lightly tannic and floral, making for an adventurous and energizing path to take., title: Donkey & Goat 2015 Grenache Noir Grenache (El Dorado), country: US, points: 90, province: California
* Product 4: variety: Rhône-style White Blend, winery: Two Moons, price: 28.0, description: Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal., title: Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles), country: US, points: 89, province: California
* Product 5: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade., title: Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon

* Product 2: description: This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price.

* Product 3: description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0
* Product 4: description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing.

* Product 3: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87
* Product 4: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92
* Product 5: province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out., title: Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 91

* Product 2: winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully.

* Product 5: winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits.

Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California
* Product 2: variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Taken Wine Co., price: 40.0, description: This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture., title: Taken Wine Co. 2014 Taken Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 88, province: California
* Product 3: variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington
* Product 4: variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington
* Product 5: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out., title: Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon

2023-09-07 21:30:45,173 - INFO - chat.py - wine_search - 46 - Search Tool found:* Product 1: price: 45.0, description: Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak. Tasted shortly after its release, it still showed a bit of a liquorous new oak scent, but without turning up the heat in the finish. The fruit is young and bright, a mix of raspberry, cassis and red licorice., title: Grand Rêve 2007 Collaboration Series III Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Syrah (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Syrah, winery: Grand Rêve
* Product 2: price: 36.0, description: The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!, title: Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 93, province: Washington, variety: Rhône-style Red Blend, winery: Doyenne
* Product 3: price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc
* Product 4: price: 50.0, description: A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day., title: Pirouette 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 98, province: Washington, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Pirouette
* Product 5: price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will

It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.
* Product 2: title: Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.
* Product 3: title: Plaisance Ranch 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Applegate Valley), country: US, points: 87, province: Oregon, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Plaisance Ranch, price: 25.0, description: Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now.
* Product 4: title: Pat Paulsen Vineyards 2013 England-Shaw Vienyard Syrah (Solano County), country: US, points: 83, province: California, variety: Syrah, winery: Pat Paulsen Vineyards, price: 24.0, description: Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style.
* Product 5: title: Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara), country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Sauvignon Blanc, winery: Dragonette, price: 42.0, description: This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend
* Product 3: winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese
* Product 4: winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak.

* Product 5: winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate.

For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers

It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.
* Product 2: title: Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 85, province: Washington, variety: Fumé Blanc, winery: Covey Run, price: 9.0, description: Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.
* Product 3: title: Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Grüner Veltliner, winery: Zocker, price: 20.0, description: Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.
* Product 4: title: McGregor 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes), country: US, points: 85, province: New York, variety: Gewürztraminer, winery: McGregor, price: 20.0, description: Fresh and delicate with floral and citrus overtones, this wine has an elegant character. Its dry, spicy flavors are subtle and refreshing, giving the wine food pairing flexibility. Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian.
* Product 5: title: Four Lanterns 2013 Fire Light Syrah (Paso Robles), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Syrah, winery: Four Lanterns, price: 62.0, description: Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.

It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.

The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers
* Product 5: price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully.

* Product 4: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
* Product 5: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)
