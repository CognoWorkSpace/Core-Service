2023-09-08 19:08:00,917 - INFO - sale_wines.py - database_search - 67 - Search Tool found:* Product 1: title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Rhône-style White Blend, winery: Francis Tannahill, price: 28.0, description: A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss., title: Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Lachini, price: 45.0, description: Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle., title: Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Andrew Will, price: 23.0, description: This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish., title: Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 88, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher, price: 35.0, description: A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune.

It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras., title: J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: points: 95, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Donum, price: 72.0, description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?, title: Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley), country: US
* Product 2: points: 93, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Turiya, price: 100.0, description: There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once., title: Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast), country: US
* Product 3: points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US
* Product 4: points: 87, province: California, variety: Sauvignon Blanc, winery: Kunde, price: 17.0, description: This wine is lightly layered and linear, with stony green apple notes over a backdrop of toasted brioche., title: Kunde 2015 Magnolia Lane Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley), country: US
* Product 5: points: 86, province: California, variety: Moscato, winery: St. Supéry, price: 25.0, description: This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish., title: St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley), country: US

* Product 2: country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak.

* Product 3: country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Taken Wine Co., price: 40.0, description: This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price.

* Product 4: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
* Product 5: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully.

* Product 2: description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal.

* Product 2: country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue.

* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Grüner Veltliner, winery: Zocker, price: 20.0, description: Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet.

* Product 2: country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade., title: Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Zinfandel, winery: Seven Deadly Zins, price: 16.0, description: Rich in leather and oak, with swirls of ripe red raspberry and blackberry cobbler, this is a big-boy Zinfandel with hair on its chest, a taste of vanilla on the finish., title: Seven Deadly Zins 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Replica, price: 26.0, description: The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath., title: Replica 2014 Pickpocket Red (California)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Grüner Veltliner, winery: Zocker, price: 20.0, description: Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish., title: Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley)

* Product 2: price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners
* Product 3: price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa.

A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery
* Product 4: price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc
* Product 5: price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: description: Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience., title: C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville), country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: C'est Bon, price: 35.0
* Product 2: description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0
* Product 3: description: A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality., title: Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Flying Goat Cellars, price: 60.0
* Product 4: description: Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue., title: Wood Family Vineyards 2010 Muy Bueno Zinfandel (Livermore Valley), country: US, points: 82, province: California, variety: Zinfandel, winery: Wood Family Vineyards, price: 32.0
* Product 5: description: Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling., title: Stephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Stephen Ross, price: 42.0

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will
* Product 2: price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners
* Product 3: price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery
* Product 4: price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc
* Product 5: price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US
* Product 5: points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

* Product 5: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0
* Product 2: description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0
* Product 3: description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0
* Product 4: description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0
* Product 5: description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit.

* Product 1: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 2: title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 3: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 4: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.
* Product 5: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.

* Product 2: price: 9.0, description: Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom.

* Product 4: price: 18.0, description: The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend.

* Product 4: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction.

* Product 3: description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade., title: Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0
* Product 4: description: Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind.

* Product 5: description: There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once., title: Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Turiya, price: 100.0

It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US
* Product 2: points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US
* Product 3: points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US
* Product 4: points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US
* Product 5: points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US

It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.
* Product 2: title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.
* Product 3: title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.
* Product 4: title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.
* Product 5: title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.

## Product information
### Here are some information of products relate with user's question, use them when you answering user's question:  
* Product 1: points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0, description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US
* Product 2: points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US
* Product 3: points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet.

Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US
* Product 4: points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US
* Product 5: points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 4: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.
* Product 5: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.

## Product information
### Here are some information of products relate with user's question, use them when you answering user's question:  
* Product 1: points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0, description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US
* Product 2: points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US
* Product 3: points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US
* Product 4: points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US
* Product 5: points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing.

* Product 2: winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend
* Product 3: winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak.

* Product 4: winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend
* Product 5: winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate.

* Product 1: price: 115.0, description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer
* Product 2: price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan
* Product 3: price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé
* Product 4: price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer
* Product 5: price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish., title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice

* Product 2: winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke.

* Product 4: winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend
* Product 5: winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa.

## Product information
### Here are some information of products relate with user's question, use them when you answering user's question:  
* Product 1: province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0, description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 97
* Product 2: province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US, points: 92
* Product 3: province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91
* Product 4: province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98
* Product 5: province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish., title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 89

It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92
* Product 2: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87
* Product 3: province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85
* Product 4: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91
* Product 5: province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate.

### Here are some information of products relate with user's question, use them when you answering user's question:  
* Product 1: country: US, points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0, description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish., title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley)

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0
* Product 2: description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0
* Product 3: description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0
* Product 4: description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0
* Product 5: description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate.

It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer
* Product 2: price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time., title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan
* Product 3: price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé
* Product 4: price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer
* Product 5: price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish., title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice

For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel.

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87
* Product 3: province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85
* Product 4: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91
* Product 5: province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate.

* Product 2: price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label.

* Product 4: price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer

The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence., title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 4: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.
* Product 5: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.

* Product 2: title: Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County), country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.
* Product 3: title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.
* Product 4: title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.
* Product 5: title: àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: Washington, variety: Marsanne-Viognier, winery: àMaurice, price: 35.0, description: The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.

* Product 4: province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91
* Product 5: province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa.

Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel.

The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine.
* Product 2: title: Murphy-Goode 2012 Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley), country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Zinfandel, winery: Murphy-Goode, price: 40.0, description: Concentrated in toasted marshmallow and juicy blackberry, this is a large, full-bodied wine marked by puckering tannins that still need time to resolve. Powerfully built, it's big on flavor and intensity, with vanilla on the finish.
* Product 3: title: Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Turiya, price: 100.0, description: There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once.
* Product 4: title: Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Ruby, price: 65.0, description: There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.
* Product 5: title: Gershon Bachus 2009 Erato De Portola Trail Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Temecula Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: California, variety: Cabernet Franc, winery: Gershon Bachus, price: 45.0, description: Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.

For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

* Product 1: variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon
* Product 2: variety: Chardonnay, winery: C'est Bon, price: 35.0, description: Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience., title: C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville), country: US, points: 88, province: California
* Product 3: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out., title: Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon
* Product 4: variety: Rhône-style White Blend, winery: Francis Tannahill, price: 28.0, description: A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss., title: Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon
* Product 5: variety: Chardonnay, winery: Le P'tit Paysan, price: 22.0, description: Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US
* Product 2: points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US
* Product 3: points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa.

* Product 4: points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US
* Product 5: points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel.

* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.

* Product 3: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
* Product 4: country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
* Product 5: country: US, points: 90, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Tinto Rey, price: 22.0, description: Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors., title: Tinto Rey 2014 Super Tinto Red (Dunnigan Hills)

The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.
* Product 2: title: Pear Valley 2013 Distraction Red (Paso Robles), country: US, points: 91, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Pear Valley, price: 35.0, description: The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose.

## Product information
### Here are some information of products relate with user's question, use them when you answering user's question: 
* Product 1: description: Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak. Tasted shortly after its release, it still showed a bit of a liquorous new oak scent, but without turning up the heat in the finish. The fruit is young and bright, a mix of raspberry, cassis and red licorice., title: Grand Rêve 2007 Collaboration Series III Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Syrah (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Syrah, winery: Grand Rêve, price: 45.0
* Product 2: description: Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato., title: Quilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills), country: US, points: 93, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Quilceda Creek, price: 85.0
* Product 3: description: This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006., title: Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 93, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Chester Kidder, price: 50.0
* Product 4: description: This blend of 71% Grenache and 29% Syrah is lively with smashed strawberries and cherries on the nose as well as stewed beef, lilacs and berry-laced pastries. Black plums and cherries show on the sip, held up by tart plum skins, rose hips and lilac flavors, rounded by a sprinkling of brown sugar., title: Four Lanterns 2013 Shadow Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles), country: US, points: 90, province: California, variety: Grenache-Syrah, winery: Four Lanterns, price: 48.0
* Product 5: description: A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras., title: J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains), country: US, points: 88, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher, price: 35.0

Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate., title: Spell 2014 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California
* Product 2: variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Donum, price: 72.0, description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?, title: Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley), country: US, points: 95, province: California
* Product 3: variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: California
* Product 4: variety: Chardonnay, winery: Marimar Estate, price: 43.0, description: Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone., title: Marimar Estate 2011 Don Miguel Vineyard Bonita's Hill Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley), country: US, points: 94, province: California
* Product 5: variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon

Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills), country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher
* Product 3: price: 22.0, description: This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly., title: Borra 2012 Markus Nimmo White (California), country: US, points: 90, province: California, variety: White Blend, winery: Borra
* Product 4: price: 85.0, description: This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate., title: Brilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District), country: US, points: 92, province: California, variety: Cabernet Sauvignon, winery: Brilliant Mistake
* Product 5: price: 18.0, description: This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years., title: Arbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Arbor Crest

* Product 2: price: 20.0, description: This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight.

* Product 2: description: Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels., title: J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills), country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher, price: 52.0
* Product 3: description: One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied., title: Peltier NV USB Red (Lodi), country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Peltier, price: 25.0
* Product 4: description: The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!, title: Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 93, province: Washington, variety: Rhône-style Red Blend, winery: Doyenne, price: 36.0
* Product 5: description: Toast, savory herb, vanilla and dark cherry aromas are followed by lush, full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. Vanilla and dill notes are speckled throughout and at times intrude., title: Ryan Patrick 2013 Elephant Mountain Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills), country: US, points: 88, province: Washington, variety: Cabernet Sauvignon, winery: Ryan Patrick, price: 50.0

Based on your preference for a wine with these characteristics, I recommend a full-bodied red wine with higher alcohol content and rich flavors.

One type of wine that fits this description is Cabernet Sauvignon. Cabernet Sauvignon is known for its bold and intense flavors, often characterized by blackcurrant, blackberry, and dark chocolate notes. It has a higher tannin level, which gives it a firm structure and contributes to its warming sensation. Cabernet Sauvignon is a classic choice for wine enthusiasts who enjoy powerful and robust wines.

Another option is Syrah, also known as Shiraz in some regions. Syrah wines are known for their dark fruit flavors, such as blackberry and plum, as well as hints of black pepper and spices. Syrah wines often have a higher alcohol content, which can provide that warming feeling you're looking for.

Lastly, Malbec is another red wine that can offer a strong and warming experience. Malbec wines are known for their deep purple color and flavors of black cherry, plum, and dark chocolate. They often have a velvety texture and a smooth finish that can be quite satisfying.

Each of these wines has its own unique characteristics, so I recommend trying a few different bottles to see which one resonates with your palate the most. If you're interested, I can provide more detailed information about a specific wine from one of these varietals. Just let me know the name of the wine you would like to learn more about.

It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.
* Product 2: title: Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 98, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 155.0, description: Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.
* Product 3: title: Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Sokol Blosser, price: 80.0, description: Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.
* Product 4: title: Lutum 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Lutum, price: 50.0, description: Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.
* Product 5: title: Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley), country: US, points: 95, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Donum, price: 72.0, description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?

Cabernet Sauvignon is known for its bold and intense flavors, often characterized by blackcurrant, blackberry, and dark chocolate notes. It has a higher tannin level, which gives it a firm structure and contributes to its warming sensation. Cabernet Sauvignon is a classic choice for wine enthusiasts who enjoy powerful and robust wines.\n\nAnother option is Syrah, also known as Shiraz in some regions. Syrah wines are known for their dark fruit flavors, such as blackberry and plum, as well as hints of black pepper and spices. Syrah wines often have a higher alcohol content, which can provide that warming feeling you're looking for.\n\nLastly, Malbec is another red wine that can offer a strong and warming experience. Malbec wines are known for their deep purple color and flavors of black cherry, plum, and dark chocolate. They often have a velvety texture and a smooth finish that can be quite satisfying.\n\nEach of these wines has its own unique characteristics, so I recommend trying a few different bottles to see which one resonates with your palate the most.

Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day., title: Pirouette 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 98, province: Washington, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Pirouette
* Product 5: price: 50.0, description: Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out., title: Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley), country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Le Cadeau

红葡萄酒是由红葡萄品种酿造而成，果皮与果肉一起发酵，因此呈现出红色。红葡萄酒通常带有浓郁的水果味，例如黑莓、樱桃和草莓等。它们可以搭配多种食物，如牛肉、烤肉和坚果等。

白葡萄酒是由白葡萄品种酿造而成，只使用果肉进行发酵，因此呈现出浅黄或淡黄色。白葡萄酒通常具有清爽的口感和酸度，搭配海鲜、家禽和奶酪等食物非常合适。

气泡酒是一种具有起泡效果的葡萄酒，最著名的就是香槟。它们可以是白葡萄酒、红葡萄酒或玫瑰葡萄酒。气泡酒通常带有活泼的气味和口感，非常适合作为庆祝或享受特殊场合的饮品。

基于您对葡萄酒的初步了解，我可以为您推荐几款适合初学者的葡萄酒。您可以选择其中一款进行进一步了解，或者告诉我您对葡萄酒的偏好，我可以为您提供更具针对性的推荐。

2023-10-25 20:45:21,289 - INFO - somme_wines.py - chat_given_history - 65 - return response is As a beginner, let me introduce you to some popular sparkling wines. Sparkling wines are known for their bubbly and effervescent nature, making them a delightful choice for celebrations or special occasions. Here are three types of sparkling wines that you might find interesting:

1. Champagne: Champagne is a sparkling wine that comes exclusively from the Champagne region in France. It is made using a traditional method called méthode champenoise, which involves a secondary fermentation in the bottle. Champagne is known for its elegance, fine bubbles, and complex flavors. It pairs well with seafood, poultry, and creamy desserts.

2. Prosecco: Prosecco is a sparkling wine from Italy, specifically the Veneto region. It is made using the Charmat method, which involves a secondary fermentation in stainless steel tanks. Prosecco is known for its fruity and floral aromas, light body, and refreshing taste. It is a great choice for casual gatherings and pairs well with light appetizers, seafood, and fruit-based desserts.

3. Cava: Cava is a sparkling wine from Spain, primarily produced in the Catalonia region. It is made using the traditional method, similar to Champagne. Cava is known for its crisp acidity, citrusy flavors, and affordable price compared to Champagne. It pairs well with tapas, grilled vegetables, and soft cheeses.

These three sparkling wines offer different styles and flavor profiles, allowing you to explore and find the one that suits your taste preferences. Let me know if you would like more information about any of these sparkling wines or if you have any specific preferences in mind.

It typically has flavors of ripe peaches, apricots, and citrus fruits, with a hint of floral notes. The sweetness of the wine is well-balanced by its refreshing acidity, creating a harmonious and enjoyable drinking experience.

In terms of body, Moscato wine is usually light-bodied, which means it has a delicate and smooth texture. It is not heavy or overpowering on the palate, making it a perfect choice for those who prefer lighter wines.

Moscato wines are not typically aged for a long time. They are meant to be consumed young to fully enjoy their vibrant and fresh flavors. However, some higher-quality Moscato wines can develop more complex flavors with a few years of aging. It's always best to check the specific wine you are interested in for its aging potential.

Regarding ratings and awards, there are several reputable wine competitions and publications that provide ratings and recognition for wines. However, the availability of such information may vary depending on the specific brand or region. It is always a good idea to research and read reviews about the particular Moscato wine you are considering to get a better understanding of its quality and reputation.

If you're interested, I can recommend a few Moscato wines that you might enjoy.
