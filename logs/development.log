2023-09-08 19:08:00,917 - INFO - sale_wines.py - database_search - 67 - Search Tool found:* Product 1: title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Rhône-style White Blend, winery: Francis Tannahill, price: 28.0, description: A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss., title: Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Lachini, price: 45.0, description: Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle., title: Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Andrew Will, price: 23.0, description: This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish., title: Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 88, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher, price: 35.0, description: A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune.

It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras., title: J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
