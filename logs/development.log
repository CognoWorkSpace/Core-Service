2023-09-08 19:08:00,917 - INFO - sale_wines.py - database_search - 67 - Search Tool found:* Product 1: title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will, price: 60.0, description: A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Rhône-style White Blend, winery: Francis Tannahill, price: 28.0, description: A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss., title: Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Lachini, price: 45.0, description: Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle., title: Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least., title: Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Andrew Will, price: 23.0, description: This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish., title: Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 88, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: J. Christopher, price: 35.0, description: A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune.

It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras., title: J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: points: 95, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Donum, price: 72.0, description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?, title: Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley), country: US
* Product 2: points: 93, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Turiya, price: 100.0, description: There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once., title: Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast), country: US
* Product 3: points: 91, province: California, variety: Marsanne, winery: Qupé, price: 35.0, description: Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff., title: Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley), country: US
* Product 4: points: 87, province: California, variety: Sauvignon Blanc, winery: Kunde, price: 17.0, description: This wine is lightly layered and linear, with stony green apple notes over a backdrop of toasted brioche., title: Kunde 2015 Magnolia Lane Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley), country: US
* Product 5: points: 86, province: California, variety: Moscato, winery: St. Supéry, price: 25.0, description: This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish., title: St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley), country: US

* Product 2: country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak.

* Product 3: country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Taken Wine Co., price: 40.0, description: This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price.

* Product 4: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
* Product 5: country: US, points: 91, province: Oregon, variety: Sparkling Blend, winery: Le Cadeau, price: 50.0, description: One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully.

* Product 2: description: The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.
* Product 2: title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.
* Product 3: title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery, price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.
* Product 4: title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc, price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.
* Product 5: title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.

This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal.

* Product 2: country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue.

* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Grüner Veltliner, winery: Zocker, price: 20.0, description: Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet.

* Product 2: country: US, points: 92, province: Oregon, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Domaine Serene, price: 65.0, description: Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade., title: Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
* Product 3: country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Zinfandel, winery: Seven Deadly Zins, price: 16.0, description: Rich in leather and oak, with swirls of ripe red raspberry and blackberry cobbler, this is a big-boy Zinfandel with hair on its chest, a taste of vanilla on the finish., title: Seven Deadly Zins 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
* Product 4: country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Red Blend, winery: Replica, price: 26.0, description: The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath., title: Replica 2014 Pickpocket Red (California)
* Product 5: country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Grüner Veltliner, winery: Zocker, price: 20.0, description: Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish., title: Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley)

* Product 2: price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners
* Product 3: price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa.

A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery
* Product 4: price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc
* Product 5: price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers

## Product information
### Here are some company's products' information:
* Product 1: description: Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience., title: C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville), country: US, points: 88, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: C'est Bon, price: 35.0
* Product 2: description: Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024., title: Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview), country: US, points: 97, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Wayfarer, price: 115.0
* Product 3: description: A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality., title: Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley), country: US, points: 93, province: California, variety: Pinot Noir, winery: Flying Goat Cellars, price: 60.0
* Product 4: description: Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue., title: Wood Family Vineyards 2010 Muy Bueno Zinfandel (Livermore Valley), country: US, points: 82, province: California, variety: Zinfandel, winery: Wood Family Vineyards, price: 32.0
* Product 5: description: Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling., title: Stephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley), country: US, points: 89, province: California, variety: Chardonnay, winery: Stephen Ross, price: 42.0

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain), country: US, points: 92, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Andrew Will
* Product 2: price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners
* Product 3: price: 18.0, description: This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine., title: Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley), country: US, points: 90, province: Washington, variety: Sangiovese, winery: Columbia Winery
* Product 4: price: 49.0, description: A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in., title: Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley), country: US, points: 85, province: California, variety: Bordeaux-style Red Blend, winery: Vin Roc
* Product 5: price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers

The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US
* Product 5: points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)), country: US

Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment., title: Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
* Product 2: country: US, points: 87, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Two Vintners, price: 25.0, description: Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak., title: Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

* Product 5: country: US, points: 91, province: Washington, variety: Red Blend, winery: Gordon Brothers, price: 30.0, description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive., title: Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

It's a pretty wine that needs to be paired with food to be fully appreciated., title: W.T.
